Openstack Nova Quickstart
-------------------------

Hopefully this provides an easy entry into running Openstack Nova in a vm.

I've divided it into two sections, a beginner and advanced.

Beginner
--------
It's going to have everything setup in a downloadable virtual box image, that 
anyone can use to just play with the Nova api.
NOTE: This is based on stable releases, the current one being Cactus.

Advanced
--------
This is more for developers and those looking to understand what's happening under
the hood. It has some detailed steps on what needs to be done to run a development
version of nova. The latest trunk code will be used for this and it's should be 
understood that things can be broken.
